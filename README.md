Music Space
===========

The internet is a shit place to put your hobby art out. You compete with
everyone on the planet, people will be mean to you, expectations are usually too
high. You are not a big record-label, you put yourself into your music and you
love some people experience it, maybe like it and download it.

At least that is my position and I was searching for a solution for years.

How it works
============

Find a QR Code in public space, scan it, listen to the music, download it.

Phase 1
-------

There is a page per song, that shows:

* A cover
* A view counter
* A play-button, with a click counter
* Downloads (aac, opus, mp3, alac, flac), with a download counter
* A like-button, with a counter

The counters should give people a sense, that they are not alone in the space.
I'd want to add some more ways to give people a sense of commonality without
using comments [1].

The QR Code "sticker" need to have a design that allow people to recognize them
as `Music Space` instantly.

[1] I feel comments are one of the big evils on the internet.

Phase 2
-------

Show a map where other songs can be found in public space. Yes one QR Code gives
you access to one track only. To access more songs you need to play geo-caching.

* A feature to report missing QR Codes.
